# entropic noise

Generative drawing based on Perlin noise using P5.js with image color sampling and mic amplitude sampling.
minimalistic drawing fun - not tying to be anything other than what it is

# some stuff todo maybe:
 - Rework UI to be moar better and stuff
 - Add walker count selector to UI
 - Add color hue, saturation, jitter with range values
 - do some more other stuffs
